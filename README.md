AstroGitHub
===========

Text and exploratory code using the Git API to explore how the Astronomy community uses GitHub and how it could be improved.


GitHub-API.ipynb
----------------

You can view the ipython notebook here:
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/acviana/AstroGitHub/master/GitHub-API.ipynbv

Or you can download it and run it yourself, but note that you will need the pygithub module.
